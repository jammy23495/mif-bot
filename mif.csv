96,1,Post,MIF,DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS FAST INTERCEPT BOAT,1. ?Background.  Several emerging/disruptive technologies have penetrated into the defense forces. Amongst these autonomous systems have reached a state of maturity and several AI based technologies in the domain of “Autonomous Vessels” have proliferated into the navies across the world. Autonomous vessels apart from having a huge cost advantage also have a clear edge over manned vessels due to their flexibility for deployment on short notice and negligible operational risk to human life.        Present Status.      2.    In order to harness the potential of these emerging technologies  DIT had partnered with M/s GSL for development of an Autonomous Fat Interceptor Boat.  The design of the boat for autonomous operation has been jointly developed by DIT and BEL. In order to achieve the autonomous capability  the interfacing of waterjets and engine had to be modified to achieve navigation computer control on buckets and nozzles. Further   the boat is equipped with several sensors and is ale to relay live stream from the sensors to ground control station. Sensors installed on the boat are as follows: -            a. Radar            b. LiDAR            c. EO Camera            d. IMU            e. Maritime Broadband Radio      3.     Trials of the boat under diffrent sea state/ environmnetal conditions and marine traffic are being progressively undertake to fine tune the algorithms. It is planned to achieve remote control of the boat from ground station over extended ranges of more than 50 Kms. ?        3.   Way ahead.  The boat is capable of avoiding static and dynamic collision in dense marine traffic. COLREGS are being incorporated into the navigation algorithms post consultation with ND School. Remote control of the boat has been demonstrated from Naval Headquarters.  As part of Phase III  following is planned: -          (a)  Integration of LiDAR to nav computer for auto-parking/ along side approach          (b) installation of SAT com terminal          (c) Installation of SONAR        ,Information Technology,  A very good initiative towards self reliance on autonomous systems. This initiative will also open a domain of autonomous systems in IN for further exploitation. The experience gathered for setting up first of its kind system will definately assist navy to go a leap further into Autonomous sytems and their integrration with existing systems/equipment/vessels. ,Admin-00066,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,6,11,2

99,3,Post,MIF,REFITS OF SHIPS/SUBMARINE,I think it should  be matter of discussion that Naval Dockyards should provide guarantee period on each DL. Ship's staff should not again raise the alarm after REFCOM . If problem arrives under guarantee period . The deffect should be liquidated on Refit based DL ,Dockyard & Refit,1.       The issue about quality/reliability of work by Dockyards in refits is a topic of regular discussion  and the guarantee clause is also a suggestion towards ensuring the same. The topic needs frank introspection on account of all concerned in the system/chain.  2.      There are multiple aspects to this problem  some of which are as below :-  (a)  The Quality / Accuracy of the DLs. Many times it is observed that the DLs are inaccurate or incomplete or generic in nature  and when the team does the work (onboard or in shop floor)  it is something else. This not only leads to wrong estimation of time  spares etc. but also creates vagueness in terms of guarantee.  (b)  Availability of Spares. Many a times the spares required for the job to be done are either not available or LP spares (of inferior quality) are available.  (c) Repair of Spares. In many cases when spares are not available  the existing items are repaired with the available resources / equipment. In such cases it is very difficult to expect a guarantee. For eg repair of pump shaft (though metal build-up) or a PCB (though local components) is not likely to have a full life.  (d) Liquidation of DLs.  A DL is liquidated by undertaking a specific job  however  many times same system/equipment tends to develop defect in another part/component. And thus a guarantee in such cases will only complicate matters.  (e) Systems.  Every equipment or component relies on the quality/hygiene of the system or other equipment with which it is connected  and defects are many time attributable to such issues. For eg. if pump is run dry post overhaul or electronic system operated with low insulation or poor power quality  is likely to have defects soon after repairs.  (f) Exploitation. The exploitation of any equipment or system plays a vital role in its performance or operational availability. Any short-cuts or deviations in exploitation (especially in refit ships  towards the end) will lead to defects.  (g) Offloaded Jobs.  Multiple jobs are offloaded to external agencies/vendors wherein the work orders have relevant guarantee/warranty clauses. However  in many cases these jobs are done during the refit and by refcom the warranty is over or the vendor has become non-responsive. Under such cases it will become difficult to undertake these as guarantee jobs. The only way to get it done is as a new/fresh job.  3.     The above is not to say that the Dockyards  their work culture and quality of work is perfect and beyond reproach. The point being that instead of looking at guarantee policy  which will lead to tonnes of infructuous correspondence and blame game  we need to look at improving the work culture at all levels/points. And notwithstanding guarantee  the ship's are the cutting edge of the sword and any defect (new or old) invariably is raised to Yards and is done by the Yards (with or without DL/RA as per recent guidelines).  4.     Accordingly  to improve quality and reliability of Dockyard jobs  the above aspects needs to be addressed. In addition  the following are also recommended for consideration towards improving the quality of jobs done by the yard :-  (a)  While it is difficult to involve Dockyard QC for all jobs owing to time constraints or lack of requisite knowledge or experience of the QC  it is recommended to enhance accountability of CM and FM of the concerned shop floor  through a department level QC/DL closing certificate iro each DL  which shall be maintained in records. These certificates shall terminate at FM level to ensure they feel responsibility of the same.  (b)  Delegation of minor financial powers to procure spares/consumables to DGMs / SMs. While there are existing procedures for the same  but in NDs (where the organisation is large) the process invariable takes time. Owing to timelines pressures  there is a tendency to use what's best available within the timelines.      ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,4,15,1

Howver  generic and specific values exist for propulsion GTs  Diesel engines  Geabox.  For shafting it is my understanding that limiting vibration values also exist with MTUs for shafting of different class of ships.    Nevertheless if specific exapmles are brought out by the OP  it will help refine the guidelines.    ACOM D&R ,Admin-00060,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,0,3,2
102,5,Post,MIF,SOFT FOOT IN MACHINERY - AN UNSUNG NEMESIS,  A study on source of defects on the engineering equipment indicates that the majority of defects occurs (50-70%) are due to misalignment. The same has been the experience at Trials Units in IN.    While misalignment is addressed by carrying out alignment either using dial guage method or laser alignment  a fatal mistake of ignoring the checks on machinery for soft foot prior carrying out the alignment is made in most of the cases (It’s a mandatory check prior alignment as per standard practices followed at Industries). The presence of soft foot makes alignment difficult for the equipment. Additionally  it gives a false sense that alignment is done correctly and satisfactorily.    Soft Foot. Soft foot is condition where the machine is not resting evenly on all feet. The condition is similar to a table with one leg smaller than others. This condition  if not corrected  makes an alignment job much more difficult. There are three types of soft foot predominantly vis. Parallel  angular and squishy foot as shown in  Figure. Checking for Soft Feet is a pre-requisite for any alignment process. If the inherent alignment of the equipment is not correct  external alignment would not matter.    The soft foot manifests into rocking of machinery which cannot be observed though naked eyes  which later leads to bearing/coupling/rotor damage. Although  the onset of defect can be picked up through vibration spectrum  usually it’s too late and equipment transact into failure mode. Thus  if adequate empathises is given to this small issues during alignment process  a large number of defects can be prevented from propagation.         Recommendations.    (a) The issue of misalignment and soft foot be given wide publicity in the technical environment.    (b) Training of yard personnel /ship staff /FMU be carried on identification and correction of soft prior carrying out the alignment.    Regards       ,Marine Engineering,Agree with the Officer. In the good old days  Eqpt Feet and SV Mounts used to be machined / lapped / polished to ensure atleast 80% mating of the metal surfaces where there is metal to metal contact. While that was one extreme Marine Engg Practice for perfection  ignoring this aspect completely seems to be the other extreme end of Marine Engg Practices. Optimal utilisation of Laser Alignment Tool by Repair Agencies along with Checks of Motor  Pump / Compressor and their Foundations for Soft Foot can be a more efficient way ahead - considering the Time Constraints that all of us operate in ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,15,3,1
103,6,Post,MIF,STANDARDISATION OF INTEGRATED PLATFORM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (IPMS) FOR FUTURE PLATFORMS,  (a)      Background.    IN has graduated to VME 64 based open architecture for control and monitoring of machinery equipment. Presently the IN is operating IPMS sourced through various vendors  this includes M/s L3 Communications  M/s L&T and M/s BHEL. The systems are presently operational on LST (L)  P-17  P-28  NOPVs and IAC-1 class of ships.         (b)     Present Status.    Owing to multiple OEMs and various source codes  despite being an open architecture the spares are not interchangeable.

With the present experience of IN in operating and maintaining VME 64 based IPMS/IMCS networks  it is possible to select the basic network hardware like Input/ Output cards  Ruggedized Displays  Keyboards etc and mention the same in SOTR. The OEMs can use the satandardized hardware in designing their system. To start with standardizing the sensors and actuators can be looked into as they form the bulk of the quantity and also the OEMs tend to have substantial profit margins in them. Hence standardising the sensors and actuators will not only reduce the inventory but would also be cost effective in the longer run. ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,4,6,2
104,6,Post,MIF,STANDARDISATION OF INTEGRATED PLATFORM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (IPMS) FOR FUTURE PLATFORMS,  (a)      Background.    IN has graduated to VME 64 based open architecture for control and monitoring of machinery equipment. Presently the IN is operating IPMS sourced through various vendors  this includes M/s L3 Communications  M/s L&T and M/s BHEL. The systems are presently operational on LST (L)  P-17  P-28  NOPVs and IAC-1 class of ships.         (b)     Present Status.    Owing to multiple OEMs and various source codes  despite being an open architecture the spares are not interchangeable. This leads to huge cost implications towards inventory management  training and setting up of maintenance/ repair facilities at Repair Yards  which in no time becomes obsolete.         (c)    Proposal.    Reduction in number of OEMs and standardisation of control cards for VME 64 based architecture. This will reduce requirement of massive spare inventory and cards could be used interchangeably across platforms by uploading the required platform software.      ,Marine Engineering,  One of the reasons for selecting VME as the preferred platform for IPMS was to ensure compatibility of components across different manufacturers.  This is akin to how ISA or PCI cards of any manufacturer can be used on any PC.  Howver  we seem to have failed in implementation to ensure compatibility  with each manufacturer slipping in their unique propietary feature that make either the hardware or software not fully compatible with competitors.  This in itself is a violation of SOTR and can be construed as Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practice.  However  we have not been able to ensure this in implementation phase after order placement in spite Naval oversight at PDR  CDR and STW phases.         So the answer may lie not so much in restricting vendor base  as in ensuring indusry standard compliance and compatibility  which will enable us to use VME cards from different sources  should shortfall in support from the OEM is experienced in service. ,Admin-00060,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,4,6,2

On receipt of suggestions and recommendations  a suitable case would be taken up with relevant stakeholdersCBPM Gap Analysis Study by Young Officers of MTU Mbi - Jun 22.pdf ,Marine Engineering,  Sir     It is a very relevent study which brings out the gaps in the CBPM framework adopted by Navy. It is disheartening that inspite of T-30 vibration analyser been in service from last 10 years  it has not been gainfully utilised and just being used as earstwhile Vib-10. The issues bought out wrt to usage of T-30  interfacing issues  software issues and most importantly linking it to the naval IT framework has been a challenge. There are alternate to M/s SPM who provides a server based software for integeration of the onboard vibration tool directly to the server which trial teams can use to analyse and trend  M/s ACOEM is one such firm who have given such solutions to DCNS  French Navy.    It is pertinent that by defination CPBM entails prediction of 'time to failure' from the onset of defect but that can only be done if sufficient vibartion data in form of spectrums be colated of the equipment. It is important that we acknowledge that we are no where close to Predictive Maintenance and have been able to reach condition based maintenanece (CBM) at the best. Thus  till the the time we solve the issue of collection of vibration spectrums (Not RMS values) from the ship (which are without human interventions)  we can not reach the next stage of Predictive maintenance.      ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,3,6,1
107,9,Post,MIF, FREQUENT LOSS OF SUCTION IN FIREMAIN AND OTHER SEA WATER PUMPS IN CASE OF FACS/ WJFACS/ SMALL CRAFTS,  1.  Smaller draughts vessels (with draughts less than 2m) like FACs/ WJFACs have an inherent problem of frequent loss of suction in fire main pumps during high speed operations and choppy sea states. Quoting an instance from own personal experience  MCR had to request Bridge to come down in Engine revolutions in order to have a raise in the sea water head in the sea tube as it was prominently visible upon removal of suction strainer from the body/ housing that the sea water column is low and the centrifugal pump's impeller was rotating dry. Whereas  as soon as the vessel's speed was reduced  the sea water column rose and water started coming out of the opened strainer housing. Upon fitment of the strainer back in place and starting the pump  it immediately developed the required suction and discharge pressures.    2.  Upon close scrutiny of the EMAPS  it was also observed that the fire main pumps had been frequently overhauled with replacement of mechanical seals on almost every occasion. It was concluded that even though below the water line  the fire main pump sea tubes do not have sufficient water head/column when the vessel is operating at higher speeds and choppy sea states.    3.  Although CAT II ABER replacement of present M/s BE pumps (80 TPH) with M/s Johnson pumps are approved and being progressed  there is a need to consider this frequent problem faced by the ship staff and revamp/ improve upon the deign.      ,Marine Engineering,  INSMA is the repository of datarelated to E-DART and E-SRAR already being uploaded by platforms on CMMS since 2021.

I realise that vertical fire pumps have numerous defects as compared to horizontal pumps used in IN because the coupling of vertical pump motor is not suitable because it does not support many physical forces which act during starting and running of the pump for instance (a) Axial Thrust (b) Radial Thrust (c) Misalignment. these leads to failure of mecanical seal or diffuser of pump. As compare in Horizontal Positioned pumps it requires coupling which can confront general misalinments and compare to vertical pumps has less pumps failure/mechanical seal failure.  2. This is my experience.  3. My request is a survey may be carried out on firemain pumps between vertical positioned and horizontal positioned. which has max deffect and necessary corrective action may be taken.      ,Marine Engineering,  Agree with you wrt to problems being faced on the vertical mounted fire pumps. As we know the space in the ships and submarines is premium and horizontal pumps tend to occupy more space. The solution  i feel is to start designing monoblock vertical centrifugal pumps similar to the ones fitted on Rusian origin ships  viz SNFs  Talwar and Teg class ships. These pumps are compact and donot require any alignment onboard ships. ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,0,4,4

The reasons could be just few  viz related to material selection  design of the flow path for optimal hydrodynamic reactions etc. Reverse Engineering of the 'R' monobloc pump components were also attempted   but that could only alleviate the immediate problem of non-availability of spares. Hence DME has initiated actions to holistically address the above issue  making use of the Russian monobloc design and material (to an extent) and manufacture couple of 'R' pumps in India.

However  it requires additional works during installation and external factors like condition of Foundation  Piping orientation and tension affects their performance. The best way to omit all these factors is to use integrated Pump and motor assembly  which is already aligned and ready to install onboard. It's simply Monoblock Pump which should be way ahead for Navy.  In my opinion  reluctance towards implementation of Monoblock Pumps onboard is primarily due to the fact that Motor maintenance is with Electrical and Pump maintenance is with Engineering  and at directorate level DEE gives specifications for motor including five shortlisted motor OEMs  while for Pump it is given by DME independently.  It is recommended that as way ahead for all critical pumps only monobloc pump model should be used. INS Jalashwa is a perfect example for this model. All pumps  are Monoblock (except for Pumps which were fitted in India as part of ABER replacement). Original US made monoblock pumps do not have any mounts and are directly mounted on foundation. Whenever Foundation found uneven due to FWT  simply placing the shims allowed installation. Overall vibration levels are very low and number of defects are also very less.  Infact  the coupled pumps fitted as ABER have higher rate of failure.  It is further recommended that REVERSE ENGINEERING of Jalashwa Firemain pumps be undertaken at IHQ level to finally have a Navy where EOs are not struggling with failure of Pumps problem.

Many of the defects encountered are not part of the trouble shooting procedures available in OEM documentation. Post completion of DR  a brief mention of the DR is undertaken in EMAPs. Depending on the criticality of the defect and the time available at hand  documentation of the defect rectification and forwarding of the same to higher organisations and ships of class (on few occasions) is undertaken. However  due to the difficulties involved in filing and retrieval of these documents  limitation of space onboard  etc  most of the documented DRs are not accessible to the personnel. This results in personnel attending to defects through hit and trial methods and undertaking DRs in a time intensive way  though the knowledge related to DR is readily available onboard some other ship. It is therefore proposed that an e-defect archive/ offline module/ Knowledge Management System be made accessible to all ships (enabled with keyword search feature) which can be updated every time the ship is alongside can be created and personnel onboard be encouraged to document the DRs undertaken onboard with relevant photographs. This measure will result in multi fold increase of efficiency of DRs and ensure better peer to peer learning rather than relying on the limited experience of personnel. Comments and recommendations from personnel at field and trial units would help in understanding the necessity of implementing this digital initiative. ? ,Marine Engineering,  1.  The idea is logical and will help is expanding knowledge base among all stakeholders. Anvesh has been a major step in this direction. However  a database is as good as the data fed into it. Here also the challenge lies in implementing it at last mile. In most cases  the SS is too busy in day to day activities that a throrough write-up with proper photographs is unlikely to happen for all DI-DR. Only limited/critical DI-DR are reported formally.      2.  For creating a more holistic database  the following aspects maybe considered :-      (a)   Content.  It is recommended that ships are encouraged to submit reports/write-up of any level/quality/length for all DI-DRs / evolutions / incidents. AEOs/ALOs or even Senior sailors/section chiefs can write a few lines and submit without running through multiple drafts/staff work for getting it cleared from HoD/CO etc. This way  there is a likelyhood that there will be a record of most defects. Specific details  if not understood from the report  can later be ascertained from the concerned ship.        (b) Digitisation and Proliferation.  Considering that most DI-DR are recorded either in EMAPs or logbooks or defect books  digitisation and submission on a common platform (CMMS etc.) is another challenge wherein there is an inherent inertia and lack of priority onboard. Accordingly  it is recommended to keep simplifying the process of feeding the data/reports on CMMS and continuously encouraging the SS to utilise the same.        3.  Lastly  it is pertinent that this database is available to ships at sea when they are facing an issue/defect. Therefore  it is required that all DI-DR reports for a class of ship or equipment are filtered and downloaded from CMMS server by all ships once a month (or as feasible). Once an updated database is downloaded onboard  the old ones can be deleted to avoid duplication and cluttering. If successful  this may lead to doing away with the defects books / EMAPs etc. over a period of time. ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,3,1,4

Any reports or causative analysis document generated on the defect can also be maintained in the digital KMS of the ship. Such a digital KMS  datbase will be very useful during rectification of  similar defects onboard and  will be more user friendly than going through EMAPs and other documents. It maybe prudent that a Generic format for maintenance of KMS database onboard all ships/ submarines wrt all aspects of ship maintenance and handling including engineering  electrical  deck machinery  navigation  gunnery  NBCD etc  is promulgated to ensure long term organisational memory of the ship/ submarine for sustenance during service life.

The same was completed with the launch of CMMS Step-Up on NUD in Feb 21. The next step was to create a ""Maintenance Scheduler"" in CMMS for providing an actionable maintenance plan for ship staff. Several rounds of discussions were held with ships staff and maintainers for taking their inputs towards designing the Maintenance Scheduler. The development was completed in Dec 21 and launched as ""Online"" UM2 vide IG 469/21. The ships were directed to undertake one time initilization of routines on CMMS-UM2 to enable them to view all the upcoming routines and close them on completion/raise FUSS as applicable.UM2 Policy and Implementation.  Policy on implemnentation of UM2 onboard ships and submaines was promulagted by DFM in Feb 2022. Since then INSMA and SMA(V) have been proactively engaging with ships staff for UM2 Implementation onboard. As on date 113/129 ships and submarines (this figure is excluding FICs & ISVs for brevity) are UM2 compliant. The FICs and ISVs are also under the ambit of UM2 are also being monitored for compliance.Offline Module.To provide access to CMMS at sea/when not connected to NUD  an Offline Module has been developed. Post requisite IT/Security approvals  the installation of CMMS Offline Module has commenced onboard ships wef  Sep 22. Offline module will be installed in each command by core teams trained by INSMA.Training.  INSMA and SMA(V) are continuoulsy imparting training to ship staff/ maintainers. CO/XO/Tech PCT courses  ab initio courses andQ courses are being trained at VAlsura  Shivaji  Satavahana and Vishwakarma.Hand holding of ships staff is required at this stage and therfore in additon to training Establishments   weekly training for ships/submarines in harbour (onboard as well as at INSMA/SMA) and training for ships proceeding for OST are also being undertaken.

All the platforms being inducted in the IN are accompanied by independent state of the art and modern control system and instrumentation ranging from simple microcontroller based to advanced PLC and VME based architecture and thus the expanse of the automation technology in Indian Navy is considered to be extensive in the near future. These systems are associated with inescapable requirement of stocking of adequate quantity of spares as the design of present day control system requires 'Repairs by Replacement' methodology for onboard maintenance and have an inherent requirement of upgrading the system/components in a span of 08-10 years due to obsolescence which has been observed to often impede the operational availability of the equipment/system. These systems therefore require skilled/ specialised maintainers onboard/ at yard with state of art Special Test and Repair Equipment at Yards to address the future requirements. Further  enabling lean manning onboard ships through automation has been one of the many objectives of the IN  however  the same has not been effective onboard IN Ships and therefore requires a re-evaluation. Are we an overseer on Automation at a Platform level or are we trying to connect up the divergent requirements of Platform Level automation vis-à-vis lean manning.? ,Marine Engineering,  1.    A very pertinent topic. While some of the aims for automation included improved relaibility  better operability  aid in quick and improved decision making  lean manning has also been one of the implied (if not stated) goals. There have been multiple discussions and studies on the topic. However  presently there is situation wherein the operator/ship's crew doesn't fully trusts the system for relaibility/capabilty. This has lead to limited/nil reduction in manning requirements due to automation.The same could be because of the follwoing :-      (a)   There are intermittent defects / errors in the system leading to losss of confidence.      (b)  Hesitance in trusting the automation completely owing to SOPs/training/good eneigneering practices wherein one is expected to be next to the equipment and utilise all his senses to assess state of an equipment.          2.    The reasons for defects / errors in these systems are many including harsh environmental conditions in machinery compartments wherein the automatic control systems of machinery are expected to run for prolonged duration  focus of organisation on inducting readily available (sometimes COTS) technology  lack of domestic and high quality manufacturing  restricted spares support view high costing and foreign dependence  limited repairs possibility on latests PCBs etc. Therefore  in such a scenario the automatic control system becomes an additional and complex system for watchkeeping and maintenance without taking away or reducing the original requirement of watchkeeping  routines  repairs etc. on the actual equipment.          3.    On the aspect of training  SOPs and mindset of an engineering crew onboard  there is need to take comprehensive feedback from ground  deliberate various aspects in depth and decide if certain changes are feasible without compromising the efficiency or sea going relaibility of the platforms.          4.   There don't seem to be immediate or ready answers to the issue. However  the follwoing maybe considered for implementation in the long term in a planned manner :-      (a)   Standardisation of automated systems with focus on interchangeability / interoperability.      (b)  Automation be implemented only where and to the extent necessary.      (c)   Ways to enhance training and reliability of the automated systems.          5.      There is also a need to relook as to how much automation is enough  and is reducing manpower on the ships by the way of automation is a realistic idea. Ships are the proverbial pointed end of the spear and reducing manpower or resources from the ships may be done when absolutely necessary. ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,0,3,2

However  the last line sums up Technical officers dilemma at all levels. Are we looking at becoming like Electrical officers  who are clueless about the weapons systems and radars fitted onboard  where at every occasion  they have to call OEM. We are Engineers and we are responsible for our machineries. If we look at various systems like IPMS  APMS etc etc  they functionally just facilitates you two things :-  1. Remote operation and monitoring. 2. Remote feedback and information generation.  These things are okey for Merchant Navy  where money and spares are available easily  OEMs get paid on time and they are ready to come onboard. As Technical officer  we really don't have control over these things and therefore we must not look at that way. We need to ask this question to ourself  what is our goal. The Goal is to run the ship  and not data crunching and remote operation.   Let's get rid of control systems  which has made life difficult due to costly repairs and monopoly. Automation at equipment level is still okey  but there is actually no requirement for EO to access IPMS in his cabin.   In my opinion  control system at only equipment level is the need of the hour  which can be bypassed if required.

126,15,Post,MIF,RATIONALISING THE ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT / SPARES INVENTORY THROUGH STANDARDISATION,Background.  Majority of equipment are presently being inducted by IN through Shipyards (new shipbuilding projects) based upon the vendor nomination and design requirements. This leads to induction of large number of different equipment by various OEMs and accordingly their spares.  Problem Area.  Owing to multiple OEMs  multiple models / versions of equipment  the inventory of equipment and spares is very large. This leads to high maintenance cost  additional training requirements  non-availability of equipment/spares due to limited budget. It is therefore required that number of equipment and spares are rationalised towards enhancing quality  reliability and interchangeability.  Proposal.  It is proposed to undertake deep selection of limited vendors (based on past performance  indigenisation content  commitment to GoI / IN etc.) as well as proven equipment models (based on quality  reliability  life cycle costing and obsolescence). Only these select equipment maybe installed on all upcoming platforms as well as ABER replacements (where feasible/required). Towards this it is recommended that instead of vendor nomination  directly equipment models (approved catalogue) be nominated during shipbuilding. The catalogue can be revised after a suitable interval to cater for change in technology / feedback from field. ,Marine Engineering,  For Marine engineering equipment   maintainability  reliability & long term supportability should be an overarching criteria and not the cutting edge technology.      Only type tested equipment/ model nos. should be nominated to cut short the delivery timelines. ,ADMIN,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,1,3,1
127,16,Post,MIF,CALIBRATION OF SENSORS AND INSTRUMENTATION OF ENGINEERING MACHINERY,In view of increasing level of Automation and Instrumentation of Engineering Machinery onboard IN Ships and considering the inescapable requirement of a large number of sensors for monitoring  control and data processing  there is a requirement to review the frequency and methodology followed for Calibration of Sensors and Instrumentation in IN. Ships are presently equipped with a number Test Equipment including Nagman Pressure and Temperature Calibrators  Frequency generators  Ultrasonic Flowmeter/level detectors which are being used by SS for in-house calibration of Sensors and Instrumentation. However  ships are still required to undertake calibration of these sensors/instrumentation and certify the same through yard facilities. Frequent removal of sensors/ instrumentations has often been observed to be having detrimental effect on the operational system. Therefore  there exist a need to review and standardise the frequency of calibration and sanctioning ships to undertake in-house calibration. Further  facilities of offloading calibration of Sensors and Instrumentation and verifying correctness of their feed to respective system without requirement of removing the sensors from the system onboard ships must also be explored through RRC.? ,Marine Engineering,  1.  Recommended .    2. Instrument devices for Indications  Alarms and Trips associated with controls system are calibrated by SS during Refits  Upgradation  Post repair  as part of Maintop routine and Six Monthly view expiry of validation.    3. On many occasions  it has been observed that an operational device (Sensor  Module  Electronic gauge / Indicator)  has been rendered BER during calibration leading to non availability of critical Trip and alarms.    4.  It is recommended that calibration of devices may be undertaken based on criticality ( VED analysis) and as MAINTOP recommendations only.    5.   The periodicity of calibration and checks of particular trip / alarm / module is recommended to be undertaken based on OEMs manual / defect history / reliability of the component which are basis for formulation of MAINTOP. ,Admin-00085,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,1,5,1
128,17,Post,MIF,STANDARDISATION OF PUMPS AND BASE PLATES,Problem Statement - Onboard all IN ships  there are a standard set of pumps like fire pumps  AC chilled water  sea water pumps  fuel transfer pumps etc.  however the type of pumps fitted in the Navy to meet these fixed requirements is very large. As a result  a capital ship today is fitted with hundreds of types of pumps. The pumps from same manufacturer and of same capacity are not interchangeable because their base plates are different and the pumps physically do not fit each other's profile.  Additionally  the pumps meant for one ship cannot be fitted even on the sister ships  thus resulting in unnecessary overheads for inventory management  procurement of spares and maintenance contracts etc.  Ideal Case  Navy has standardised technical specifications for 10-20 pump types based on capacity and size. All pumps conforming to the same standard should be interchangeable without any adjustment / adaptor. SNFs in their original fit had this kind of standardisation.  It is proposed that the existing variety of pumps in the Navy be reduced through a series of long term measures.  Step 1 - A standard template be created in consultation with OEMs and academia (as relevant). The template must list down all parameters that define a pump uniquely. These parameters may include weight  size  material used  pumping capacity  impeller size  material and type  bearing type and size  base plate dimensions etc.  Step 2 - Navy's pumping requirements may be segregated in categories such that one standard template should meet the requirement with some margin for overdesign. It is a layman's estimate that not more than 20-30 types of pumps will meet all the naval requirements.  Step 3 - Communication be established with major pump OEMs for filling out the template created at Step 1 for meeting all naval requirements. At the end of this step  we should get 20-30 pump standards. This activity should be carried out in consultation with centralised industry representative organisations like FICCI  ASSOCHAM  NASSCOM etc. as relevant so that inter-OEM frictions can be resolved without Naval intervention. Assistance may also be taken from National Standardisation organisations like Directorate of Standardisation and Bureau of Indian Standards. NATO standards may also be referred.  Step 4 - Publish RFI to identify vendors that are willing to deliver pumps as per Naval standards. This will enable Navy to establish date of promulgation of the standards.  Step 5 - Mandate the use of standardised pumps in all ships under construction  as deemed appropriate.  This is a long term proposal and Steps 1-5 are likely to take around 5-7 years.  Envisaged Advantages  This is the first step that will enable the Navy to standardise pumps in a future update and reduce the variety of pumps onboard ships.  Assured inter-usability of pumps  within a ship and between ships.  More flexibility in inventory and spare management.  More volumes and less variety in repair contracts thus enhancing economy of scale.                     ,Marine Engineering,  A good move. Once implemented  will drastically reduce aspects of maintenance spares and downtime of critical systems those are dependent on Pumps/motors. ,Admin-00056,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,8,3,1

Communication  EW  Data Link  IFF  ESM  GPS  TACAN and Wifi antenna etc) in a common single mast  thereby leading reduction in density of aerial population on upper decks with increased stealth features of a modern warship.  2.       The antenna structure has been developed by ATLA  Japan along with other Japanese industries including M/s NEC  M/s Hitachi  M/s Mitsubishi and M/s Itochu. The system is presently installed onboard two JMSDF platforms which are undergoing sea trials.  3.       The antenna customised for the Indian requirement is envisaged to initially have Communication (V/UHF)  EW (R-ESM)  COMINT  Data Link and IFF antennae inside the UNICORN structure. These antennae will be interfaced with the Indian communication sets for communication. The development  customisation (to suit requirements of the Indian Side) and delivery of UNICORN antenna is likely to take three-four years.       Present Status  4.       Discussions are in progress with the Japanese Side and modalities are being worked out to progress the project.

I would like to offer the following comments:-  (a)    The Importance of ensuring simplex communication for submarines need no emphasis. Therefore  the concept of this new antenna could be extended to submarines.  (b)    When you mention Communication  I guess it includes SATCOM and VLF  both essential for Submarines.  (c)    A separate VLF-loop Aerial is provided on submarines in addition to the Trailing Wire Antenna/ Aerial (TWA)  (d)   Frequent defects on this independently mounted antenna mainly caused due to low insulation is a cause of concern  (d)   Since you have already indicated that it would be a radome structure  you can look at the following types of radomes already pressure tested to Maximum Operating Depth (MOD):-                 (i)   ANIS Radome - S'Ghosh class                (ii)  ANANAS Radome - SPVs                (iii)  AT-4125 Radome - S'Mar and Kalvari Class  (e)    If you can get the dimensional drawings of these antennae from DSMAQ  it would help you to decide/ negotiate better for incorporating the Multi-functional/ multiple spectrum antennae in the available space.  (f)   Although these are not SOTRs  I feel that should the space be a constraint  the R-ESM (which is already a separate antenna) can be excluded and VLF loop aerial could be considered for incorporation into the radome.  (g)   Another useful input is that the hoistable whip aerial of S'Ghosh class has been removed and presently HF- Duplex communication is being undertaken through the ANIS antenna.   (h)   You may like to study this feature  because the Mast-deck of the ship exclusively houses the Whipaerials along with their Antenna Base Tuning (ABT) Units. This is usually forbidden for humans during transmissions.  (j)   If a compact radome structure which houses a HF antenna akin to the ANIS MAst of S'Ghosh class could be considered  it may save space  effort  EMI/ EMC requirements and maintenance.

137,24,Post,MIF,INDUCTION OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES FOR SHIP APPLICATION,   Background.    Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs) have evolved over the last three decades and the present day chemistries have delivered superior performance in terms of energy density  compactness in size and weight  charging time  number of charge-discharge cycles  operating temperature range etc. Advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS) have been developed which can monitor and control vital parameters (voltage  charging current  temperature) of individual cells of entire battery pack thereby making them safer to operate. Considering these benefits  induction of LIBs for ship borne applications is being pursued by DEE as part of CC 22/01 Action Point.      Approach.                The superior performance of LIBs  makes them a natural technology option for Naval platforms towards improving equipment performance and overall efficiency. Ship based applications of Lithium batteries  like any other Naval equipment  come with specific requirement of shock  vibration  compatibility with marine environment and EMI/EMC compliance. While efforts are already in hand to develop lithium based batteries for submarine propulsion application  few potential applications of LIBs for surface ship are as follows: -        Cold Cranking of Prime Movers.      These applications typically involve emergency start to alternators. They demand high cranking power to start engines from zero RPM. LIBs are envisaged to be more effective and reliable during emergencies where batteries are required for black out recovery.        UPS Battery backup.              Critical navigation  communication  weapon and embedded systems onboard ships require Ruggedised UPS based battery backup as per extant policy. Implementation of LIBs is envisaged to improve their performance and reliability.        Electric Propulsion. A project on Lithium Ion Battery based Electric Propulsion Drive for RIBs is being steered by DEE in liaison with DNA through iDEX Open Challenge project. Successful implementation of the project would encourage IN towards adopting electric propulsion for Yard Craft.        Power Source for AELs.   Upgrade of existing AELs with Ni-MH batteries is in progress and trial of LFP (Lithium Ferro Phosphate) battery based AELs with improved performance  life and reliability are nearing conclusion.        Factors affecting implementation   Safety  Life Cycle Support and Cost (in that order) would be the critical factors to be considered for pan-Navy induction of LIBs and promulgation of policy directives. Additionally  advancements in battery technology with Sodium Ion Batteries (SIBs) and Solid State Batteries are progressing at a fast pace. Considering limited global Lithium reserves and efforts involved in obtaining associated metals required for LIBs  the issue of obsolescence could occur earlier than expected.        Comments Sought        Potential ship borne applications where LIB technology can be gainfully used.        Factors to be considered towards formulating policy directives.        Research/ development efforts to be taken in emerging battery technologies.           ,Power Gen & Distribution,"While the proposal has its merits, there are certain known pitfalls with Li-Fe or Li-Ion technology. The biggest is due to the high reactivity (explosive) of lithium with water and the high temperature of the consequent exothermic reaction. Other is controlled manufacturing approach. Despite being a leader in its field, Samsung failed to put due quality controls in its battery manufacturing process leading to the debacle of the Samsung Note. In a enclosed environment likle submarine or ship, a lithium fire would have highly devastating circumstances as the temperatures generated would be near/ beyond the melting point of steel. Therefore, it is recommended that we formulate strict manufacturing and testing norms  for these batteries and consider encasing them in a suitable quenching medium as is done in an HRC fuse.",Admin-00081,2023-04-20 17:34:00.0033333 +00:00,4,8,1
138,25,Post,MIF,DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS INTEGRATED MAST ,Background  1.    The development of UNICORN antenna (Japanese Integrated Mast) is being progressed with M/s ATLA  Japan with BEL (Bg) as production partner. However  the lead time for realisation of UNICORN antenna customised forIN requirements is likely to take three-four years view technological challenges and finalisation of Terms and Conditions for Transfer of Technology. Therefore  it has been decided to undertake a parallel project for in-house development of an Indigenous Integrated Mast (IIM) (in limited scope) forIN Ships on fast track. The ‘IN requirements’ for the proposed IIM envisages integration of following system antenna on a single mast without radome:-               (a)  ELINT (Shakti  Ellora  Varuna Light)          (b)  COMINT (Nayan  ELK 7036)          (c)  CAW/V/UHF          (d)  Data Link (SDR NC/Tac)       Present Status  2.      The broad technical specifications of the IIM have been discussed with BEL(Bg). The antenna modelling and EMI/EMC issues have been deliberated with NEC(Mbi). The final design envisages installation of Data Link (L Band) antenna on top most part of the IIM  thereafter COMINT and ELINT antenna would be installed. The bottom most antenna will comprise Rhode and Schwarz make antenna for V/UHF communication.  3.       As part of the development  feasibility study is being progressed onboard P15B ship for installation of IIM. EMI/EMC study of antennae system by NEC(Mbi) is in final stages  which will be followed by structural analysis of antenna chassis and ship structure for installation related issues by DND (SSG).         4.      Comments Sought.  Comments are solicited for the following: -           (a)   Design ideas for development of Indigenous Integrated Mast onboard IN platforms.           (b)   Implementation aspects  EMI/ EMC  level of expertise/ manpower training required.      ,Communication System,NULL,NULL,NULL,6,9,0

148,35,Post,MIF,A COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR UNSHACKLING THE POWER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,  The decisison to implement Artificial Intelligence models in any process or a system  is based on leveraging the relevant  information embedded in available data  its assessment in a specific context  so that an optimal solution is available in an acceptabl;e time frame to improve the outcome either in quality  time or resources consumed. Swarm Intelligence (SI) is an evolved branch of AI which deals in collective ot collaborative behavior of elements in decentralised and self organised systems. With I.N moving towards Internet of Things (IoT) in future systems  SI takes its prominence lijke never before.    As IoT systems are complex and consist of smart elements/ nodes  SI algorithms would eventually become inevitable to harness the power of edge IoT devices. Some of the advantages which can be effectively harnessed  even today  includes solving problems of hierarchical processing of data for decisison-making  effective allocation of resources (at tactical / operational/ strategic levels) and overcoming performance issue of IoT/ edge devices due to their dynamic properties and mobility. SI algorithms are already well established and have been applied in real-time problems. An interesting characteristic of a SI model is that it could be modelled to suit the context viz. assured positive outcome / resource optimisation and allocation/ time criticality etc.    Therefore  harnessing the power of SI  in collaborative systems framework  is the way ahead for I.N  especially when all the systems (onboard or ashore)  are now networked. This would begin with dedicated efforts towards classification of all the data available on a network or a system  in terms of its content  inference  persistence  quality and time. The data classification need not necessary be in vertical silos but will also be contextual for cross referencing across domains for better heuristic appreciation and accurate decision-making. ,Weapons and Sensors,  Dear Sir    1.             Over the recent years  a lot of 'talk' is happening within IN as far as AI/ML is concerned with both these terms being used very loosely. However  a lot less 'walk' (perceptible to non-domain specialist like me) is actually happening on ground. This is especially disconcerting  as brought out by multiple studies  the success rate of either AI or ML products post production is less than 5%. Hence  if as IN  we intend to deploy AI and ML related products in mainstream platforms  the number of products in development should be more by a magnitude.      2.             AI and ML development is directly hinged on availability of domain expertise and availability of easily accessible data. While the former is available aplenty  the latter is a matter of significant concern. As correctly pointed out by you  harnessing power of SI  there is need for data classification and the same is contingent on availability of open data sources.    3.             The data available within IN is shrouded in layers of secrecy locked by multiple bureaucratic chains and there is an urgent and inescapable need to unshackle the same  if we really intend to Walk the Talk.  The Material Branch itself holds a gargantuan amount of data that if released and coupled with the right set of openly available development tools can really set the ball rolling. Databases of ILMS  SDRS  EDART  WLMS  Yard applications etc hold a potential that needs to be harnessed now. While InfoSec concerns are genuine  the same can be easily achieved by suitable data obfuscation.    4.             Secondly  there is a need to provide personnel with a web based development platform (like Kaggle or Colab or Paperweight) to undertake Exploratory Data analysis and build and test AI and ML models without the requirement to take the data outside the network to do the same. I am certain that we must have created basic AI/ML familiarisation setup in training institutions and already have some basic high performance computing resources which are adequate to at least kick-start the process. Again  these resources are in silos and not available to personnel at large. Hence it is also recommended that these resources be aggregated and ‘public’ access to the same be provided.    5.             Thirdly  presently development of AI or ML related products intra IN is presently limited to certain units/ establishment/ directorates and hence are being steered institutionally. However  innovations in this field in particular have not come from institutions but by people pooling their knowledge and institutions proving a supporting resource framework. Availability of such an enabling framework will certainly attract and channelise the talent already available in the Navy and enable us to develop products at a faster rate so as to achieve make real strides in this domain.      ,Admin-00081,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,4,16,1

157,43,Post,MIF,DO WE NEED TO VENTURE MORE IN FIDIC NORMS FOR CREATING MARINE INFRASTRUCTURE?,  1.         Creation of Marine Infrastructure has always remained a ‘niche’ field  and somewhat major chunk of ‘Naval Engineers’ have remained deprived of nuances  of it  as it is never considered part of ‘core competency’. Of late  the charter of responsibility of building/ augmentation of major infrastructure like dry docks  jetties  breakwater  slipway  shiplift and creation of OTR ports are entrusted on Naval Engineers/ Mat Branch. This involves extraneous planning  listing/ admin approval of MoD  execution through DGNPs/ Port Trust/ or through Govt/ Pvt Firms  having technical ‘know-how’ of  marine constructions.    2.         Conventional way of contract execution and its management  which is mainly governed by protocols laid by MES/ E-in-C branch found to be lopsided with all responsibilities given to contractors on placement of order. This has been one of the reasons of delays in complex marine technical projects  as the projects are marred with cash flow issues  subsequently leading to multiple arbitrations.    3.           To mitigate this  IN tech fraternity resorted to using FIDIC (International Federation of Consulting Engineers) norms  which provides suites of contracts and charter ship for consulting engineers. The norms are governed by Colour Coded books  namely red book (for pure civil engineering contracts)  yellow book (electrical/ mechanical projects for ‘design and build’)  silver book (for turnkey projects)  gold book (for ‘design  build and operate’ contract)  etc. FIDIC includes three parties viz. employer (in our case IN/ MoD)  FIDIC Engineer {Project Management Consultant (PMC)} and Contractor (DGNPs/ Port Trust in case of ‘Deposit Work’ etc.).    4.         For the first time  the FIDIC yellow book norms were used in construction of Aircraft Carrier Dock  Mumbai and the similar norms are being proposed for construction of Outer Harbour and Jetty at Vizag  construction of 10000 T Shiplift at ND(Vzg) and Additional Berthing Facility at Mumbai.    5.         Out of many advantages of FIDIC norms over MES contracting methods  the vital one is dispute resolution  which can be undertaken concurrent with the work  as ‘FIDIC Engineer/ PMC’ act as an arbitrator. Also  equal obligation is shared between employers and contractor for release of dues within fixed time; contractor is entitled for variation in order for additional cost and extension of time as determined by FIDIC engineer due to technical complexity  exigencies etc.    6.         The question remains that while we have started using Yellow book of FIDIC norms for some big ticket infrastructure projects  should be look into other norms existing viz. Silver Book (for turnkey projects) or Gold Book (Design  Build and Operate projects)  as the growing infrastructure need commensurate manpower  which is unlikely to come up?         Cdr Prashant Pandit    Directorate of Dockyards ,Dockyard & Refit,"Dear Prashant    I think it is a very good idea to invoke the ""Gold Book"".   When I was AGM(YS) in ND(Mbi)  I had done a statistical study on the utilisation of Yard Services.  The Shore Supply was analysed for four types of platforms - Fleet 'A' (50Hz)  Fleet 'B' (60Hz)  Flotilla and Submarines.  It turned out that the utilisation of Shore Supply was the least in case of Fleet 'A' even when they were 'first ships'.  In Contrast  the utilisation by Fleet 'B' was almost 90% even for third ships at times.  The fundamental difference was that the cables were pulled by ND(Mbi) for Fleet'B' while it was being pulled by SS for Fleet 'A'.  I wanted to initiate O&M contract for cable pulling so that ND could support the Fleet 'A' ships.  This was however a sensitive issue  for obvious reasons.  The concept was however existing for Submarine battery charging owing to the restrictions on OT.  Therefore I think that it is a good idea to have a nodal agency accountable for all aspects.  You have indicated Design  Build and Operate. I would recommend Design  Build  Operate and Maintain.  The first place to experiment could be the two berths which are coming up at Karwar exclusively for submarines.  You would be looking at DC Shore Supply  DC Battery Charging (difference between the two is w.r.t Max Operating Voltage  60Hz AC Shore Supply  400Hz AC Shore Supply  HPAir Charging  Chilled Air  DM water  Fresh/ Drinking water  Fuel and LubOil Provisioning besides Crane support.  If designed carefully  all these utilities could be located away (either at the end of jetty or in the gallery area/ caissons akin to SBW in Mumbai)  with only cope points available at the jetty  thereby decluttering the place and avoiding the grime that settles down due to the auto blowing of the compressors. The entire gamut could be operated through SCADA and monitoring done through CCTV  so that watch-keeping requirements would come down.  These could be fixed facilities so that they become dedicated submarine berths.  You need watch-keepers to operate the facilities and 3-year warranty followed by AMC for both preventive and breakdown maintenance.   I would suggest that the warranty part could be limited to spares  while you can employ specialists for maintenance right from the beginning so that the firm cannot feign loss of expertise due to protracted delays in asking for the AMC.

FIDIC also reduces the manpower requirement of the client which is always scarce especially in the field of complex infrastructure projects. In this context  adoption of FIDIC red book (applicable for civil with EM work also) for projects with relatively lesser complexity and Yellow book for more complex projects can be the way forward. Of course  yellow book contracts would come at a higher cost since design responsibility will rest with the contractor. Use of silver and gold book contracts are not considered suitable for the IN. FIDIC blue book can be used for capital dredging projects.Dispute resolution during the currency of the contract  an inherent concept of FIDIC contracts  is a double edged sword. While it would attract big contractors  it takes a lot out of the project team to prepare and defend high value claims (with little of no exposure to such legalities and pitted against hihly competent legal/contract teams of big contractors) while at the same time executing the project. Whenever a FIDIC contract is concluded  the parties would be the Employer (the contract accepting authority   CAA  such as DGNP  CE etc)  the Engineer and the Contractor. It is important that at the time of seeking GoI approval for the project  approval for execution under  FIDIC norms  and the  empowerment of the CAA  to act as the employer should be claerly sought  in the absence of which  the entire concept of a FIDIC contract will become redundant.  ,Admin-00080,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,6,21,3

Accordingly  the philosophy of regular maintenance of the system through Ventilation Maintenance Party (VMP) has been implemented onboard IN ships. With significant advancements in design philosophy and incorporation of advanced technologies/ automation  the ventilation system onboard IN ships are quite reliable and designed to provide conducive environment onboard with minimal maintenance. However  during majority of ventilation trials onboard ships  operational as well as those completing long refits  the environmental conditions have been found to be below par and the system found to be functioning sub-optimally. In most of the cases  the system performance improved on completion of necessary routines/ repairs.

(a) Role of Professional Training Establishments. IN has a set of workforce responsible for maintaining various systems and eqpt on-board ships. These personnel are trained at professional schools for long durations to attain the desired knowledge levels and are expected to be specialists of their systems. In case of sub-optimal performance of a system  it is important that the human aspect i.e competence levels of system maintainers may also be assessed. If found deficient  a feedback on the same may be sent to the professional school/ establishment so that corrections  if any  required in training curriculum can be made. Moreover  if a system (with no design deficiency) is performing sub-optimal on most of the platforms  the inadequacies in professional training at training establishments may also be a reason.  Further  Adhoc workshops  seminars only bring fanfare to the issue and do not contribute to the knowledge level of on-ground work force and therefore shall be discouraged.  (b)     System Knowledge of Operators. As the system gets operated by every person on-board ship  and therefore it is important that basic operating knowledge of the system is possessed by all personnel serving on-board. This can be achieved by inclusion of this subject  covering basic aspects  and do`s/ don’t`s in training curriculum of all training schools of Indian Navy.      (c) Maintenance Issues. The major part of HVAC system other than AC plants is under domain of hull dept (excluding electrical component) and is generally attended to only on breakdown maintenance basis. The prime reason for this is ships not forming Ventilation Maintenance Parties/ adhoc nomination of sailors for these parties  in case they are formed.  The meagre manpower allotted to these parties is also rotated very frequently which reduces their efficacy significantly.  (d) Refitting Issues. During refits  the various components of this system are attended by different centres of refitting agency which results in lack of accountability for post repairs performance of the system as a whole.  The task of integration of these subsystems/ components is generally left to the ship staff followed by offering of trials to trial agencies. In order to improve accountability  it is recommended that repairs of all HVAC related systems/ subcomponents may be brought under one division of Yard. Further  the refitting yard may be made presenting agency for Harbour phase of HVAC trials to Ship staff. SS may then further present sea trials to Trial agencies.  (e) Non-Availability of Base Line Data. Whilst conduct of post refit trials  most of the ships have reported non- availability of Base line data/ GRAQs. This results in unawareness of ship staff about the system performance standards and operating regimes during various conditions. Further  conduct of post refit trials without baseline data results only in generation of data indicating present status of the system. It is therefore recommended that one time audit of availability of baseline data for all class of ships may be undertaken and deficiencies may be made good by obtaining the same from shipyards/ IHQ/ DND/DSP.   ,Admin-00073,2023-04-12 16:09:51.3633333 +00:00,4,19,2

Application of Transcritical CO2 is a niche technology and an AC Plant designed on this technology is the first of its kind in the country. The plant has been commissioned on 16 Sep 22 and operating satisfactorily over the last month. This is a 30TR plant and once this technology is proven by successfully exploiting the plant over the next six months (till Mar 23) in varied ambient conditions  the way ahead would be to develop a plant of a higher capacity for installation on board an existing ship.    2.   CO2 is classified as A1 refrigerant by ASHRAE (Americal Society of Heating  Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) Standard 34  indicating it as non-toxic and non-flammable. Having molar mass of 44 g/mol which is higher than that of air (28 g/mol)  CO2 is heavier than air. Accordingly  the design of this plant caters to a leak detection sensor installed on lower part of the skid which activates an A/V alarm when the concentration of CO2 exceeds 5000 ppm.

167,48,Post,MIF,DESIGN OF MAIN ENGINE NR FLAP OF LCU MK IV SHIPS,       1.         LCU MK IV ships are fitted with MTU4000 Series engines with exhaust trunking located on the ship’s side. The exhaust trunking consists of a NR flap which remains open during the operation of engine and automatically shuts in case of trip/shutdown of engine    2.         There have been several instances of sea water ingress into the main engine which have been attributed to malfunction of NR flap  provisioning of inadequate drain lines in the exhaust trunking  poor sealing of flap and the peripheral gap that exists between the circumference of NR flap and the casing. Whilst several modifications have been undertaken such as provisioning of additional drain lines  formulation of SOPs in case of engine shutdown and upgradation of the Flap Control Unit  the core issue remains unsolved  i.e. suboptimal sealing of the NR flap.    3.         Increasing the diameter of the flap to seal the circumferential gap and providing a gasket around the flap which can withstand high exhaust temperatures would address this core issue of sea water ingress and provide a robust solution for this recurring defect    4.         Suggestions and comments on this solution may please be shared. ,Marine Engineering,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,11,0

Current Scenario.  Presently  the running hours of deck machinery requiring periodic and time / hours based maintenance is logged manually. Apart from manual errors  usually  on ships  the filling of such data (iro machinery where there is no watch-keeping involved) is mostly undertaken just before the submission of returns and prone to approximations. Therefore  while there exists a huge repository of data  the reliability of it for predicting failures of machinery and equipment is not very high.    Conclusion.  Therefore  fitment of time loggers on each such machinery and component  which automatically generate the running data and relay the same to a computer system in the desired form (i.e Excel sheet  graph  document  etc) can prove immensely beneficial in record keeping and analysis whilst also reducing paper work. Suggetions discussions on the same are kindly invited.      ,Hull,"Good suggestion but is more relevant to continuous running equipment 'unlike' deck machinery viz anchor capstans, boat davits etc. Continuous data looging is available on ICCP system.

The Aligner 224 is an optical tracking evaluation system and is designed for ship-board weapon systems enabling complete alignment checks for both trackers and weapon stations. On the other hand  Aligner 308 has been designed for static alignment enabling tilt checks of ship-board weapon systems in afloat conditions. Upon induction  the STTE has been supplied to dockyards  FTTTs and training schools. While these equipment have found extensive utilisation  their maintenance and repairs is an area of concern. There exist no repair facilities at Naval Dockyards to repair the same because of their specialized nature. To substantiate  the Aligners 224 and 308 held with ND (Mbi) and INS Valsura have been defective for considerable amount of time in absence of maintenance support from OEM.   Maintenance and Repair Constraints.  At present  there exists no maintenance/ repair philosophy for the aligners despite their increased exploitation onboard ships. Few issues meriting attention are enumerated below: -   No AMC/ RRC contracts for the same have been concluded till date by FTTTs/ ND (Mbi). Any assistance sought from the OEM through telephonic conversations/ e-mails in case of defects have had limited results.   The Aligners 224 and 308 were procured by WED (Mbi) through indents raised by IHQ MoD (N)/ DWE and handed over to various agencies. There are no onshore assistance teams positioned in India to attend to the defects/ maintenance issues. This leads to the STTE being rendered defective for prolonged periods.   Non-availability of maintenance support for defective equipment has a detrimental impact on combat worthiness of weapons and sensors. While these STTE are third party tools  they are state of the art and have considerable advantages over the conventional methodologies. As a case in point  Aligner 308 has a significant advantage over the conventional clinometer for tilt checks which can only be done in dry docks as against the former which can be utilized even in afloat conditions on all platforms. Further  exploitation of Aligner 224 assumes significant importance in carrying out dynamic alignment checks of systems like Lynx and Barak.   Recommendations.           In view of the above-mentioned issues  following are recommended: -   With the proliferation of naval platforms  there exists a requirement of augmenting the STTE. This activity would progress expeditiously if similar indigenous equipment is made available. Accordingly  feasibility of indigenisation of these aligners may be explored. Towards the same  INS Valsura has projected the subject requirement as an iDex challenge in order to accord priority to the same.   Conclusion of AMC/ RRC for extending maintenance support and positioning support teams in India so as to render technical assistance in case of defects.    ,Weapons and Sensors,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,12,0
170,51,Post,MIF,DRAFT ADVISORY ON AC PLANTS HVAC AND MACHINERY COMPARTMENTS VENTILATION SYSTEM OF TALWAR / TEG CLASS,  1.       NATAA has been engaged in ascertaining core materiel issues adversely affecting IN ships/ submarines with an aim to find implementable solutions in a systemic manner. Optimal functioning of HVAC is critical for mission accomplishment through improved habitability for prolonged deployments along with optimal functioning of Weapon/ Sensors for consistent performance.  2.       NATAA has identified the sub-optimal performance of HVAC systems of Talwar/ Teg class as a major shortcoming. These platforms are densely packed with equipment/ systems which require good ventilation at low temperatures for optimum performance of control components including Weapons/ Sensors.  NATAA along with MTU(Mbi) and HITU(Mbi) has progressively undertaken detailed study wrt sub-optimal performance of AC plants  HVAC and associated systems including machinery compartments ventilation on-board Talwar/ Teg class ships since 2018. During the study  it has emerged that even though respective trial agencies (MTU  HITU and ETMA) undertake trials to achieve the satisfactory state of their individual equipment and systems  the ventilation efficiency of compartments onboard these ships remains sub-optimal. The interplay of AC Plants  chilled water system  ventilation trunkings  ATUs/ HEs  automatic control components in HVAC system including supply  exhaust and re-circulation blowers are often overlooked and this leads to sub-optimal performance of the entire HVAC and machinery compartments ventilation system. NATAA through concerted efforts has synergised the efforts of various trial units in achieving desired results and accordingly  integrated and comprehensive trials of AC Plants  HVAC and machinery compartment ventilation system by various trial units has commenced.  3.       Towards this  a detailed advisory on the AC Plants  HVAC and Machinery Compartment Ventilation system for Talwar/Teg class ships has been formulated. This document would aid in sensitizing the ship’s staff towards optimum exploitation of AC plants  HVAC system and Machinery Compartment Ventilation system onboard. The draft advisory has been posted in the NATAA website ( Paschim >> WNC Website >> Trial Units >> NATAA >> Policies & Directives >> Guidelines) and the link for the same is placed for quick access (NATAA). It is requested that the contents of the advisory be perused and comments wrt additions/ changes in the content be forwarded for consideration prior issue.      ,Hull,"We need to understand that the original fit AC Plants on Tlw/Teg Class of ships are not designed for Tropical Conditions and therefore are underdesigned for the Majority of Area of Operation of these platforms...Also the Chiller unit of the Plants is designed to provide only 2.5 Deg C of temp drop in the Chilled Water....The only way to achieve optimal and effective Air Conditioning on these platforms, for balance of life,  is to undertake ABER Replacements of the original fit AC Plants...

171,52,Post,MIF,EXTENT OF AUTOMATION ON INDIAN NAVAL PLATFORMS ,  Introduction.   Across all newly inducted platforms  Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) has become a standard platform level control and monitoring system besides equipment specific control systems. Given the proliferation of automation in machinery controls  there is a need to determine the impact and necessity of inherent expertise and cognitive efficiency of the man behind the machine. Further  there is also a need to examine the dependence/ over-reliance of the watch keeper on machine inputs and the impact of this dependency on the skill sets required for Defect Identification/ Defect Rectification (DI/ DR).    Proposal.   There is requirement to ‘optimise and balance’ the automation required for future generation warships towards improved reliability  safety of operation  ease of watch keeping  fault finding and diagnostics capabilities along with improved redundancy. Development of newer generation IPMS (IPMS Mk-2) is recommended which is an optimised version of the existing IPMS. Besides control and monitoring  additional features such as data logging  trouble shooting  fault finding and auto-change over should be incorporated across newer generation systems. The system should also have training modules to acquaint the operator of the basics of the system along with sufficient data base of the previously occurred defects/ faults which can be utilised by the operator for reference during DI/DR. Additionally  Artificial Intelligence (AI) based prediction software/ modules are to be included in the system for prediction of impending defects by real time monitoring of operational parameters and flagging of abnormal parameters. Further  rationalisation of automation onboard newer generation ships based on class and role of the platform is also recommended.

It is opined that there is a requirement of taking up a case for induction of Diploma holders for the Engineering branch  as being done by the Army and the Air Force on priority. This will obviate the likely scenario of Engineering branch sailors being required to be trained for a further extended duration at Shivaji  subsequent to their selection for extended service.

174,55,Post,MIF,STANDARDIZATION OF ICCP ANODES,  Sir       During a recent case when ICCP anode of one P-15A ship were to be changed during docking  the anodes were not in stock. When suitability of using anodes from P-15B or P-17A project was checkes  it was found that the same are not compatible with P-15A ship. Thus  a need is felt to standardise ICCP anodes to the extent feasible to ensure inter-changeability at short notice  as there is hardly any time during AMP dockings to place demand and get the correct item. Purchasing under NFC  though lucrative ans fast option may also result in compromise on quality. Diver-replaceable anodes wouls definitely a big relief in future. However  post addressing all cable faults  shorting etc  the life of the anode should be ideally 20-25 years  but it is observed that  frequent failures are becoming a norm rather than exception. Accordingly  even with all its advantages and redundancies  the ICCP system is the most misunderstood and mis-represented system. This begs a bigger question as to single point ownership of the system. HITU (IN organisation) and NMRL(IN Lab) act in advisory capacity but usually only when there is an issue. Nobody bothers about maintaining the system when it is ops. In repair Yard there is an urgent need to nominate single point responsibility for execution of all repairs and checks related to ICCP system. QC(L)  FAB  OUT  WECORs  along with OEM  NMRL and HITU - SS gets so over-whelmed with the multiple correspondences  that they pray for defect-free ICCP rather than maintaining it. It is strongly recommended that single point responsibility centre in DYDs be nominated for ICCP repairs. Or else  Long term RCs with OEMs may be explored to undertake repairs during every docking. This would also solve spares availability problem to a certain extent. ,Hull,"The queries highlighted by the author has been examined at IHQ and the following are germane in this regard:-  (a) Standardization of ICCP Anodes.    The ICCP anodes are standardized into three types, based on their current capacity viz. 12.5A, 25A and 50A. The selection of anodes are done considering the hull form, underwater wetted area and general arrangement of compartments. Similar current carrying capacity anodes can be inter-changed during dry dock.  (b) Spare Availability Issue.    IHQ(N), vide policy letter NC/0535-001 dated 28 Nov 22, had issued an advisory on maintenance of ICCP system onboard IN Ships. Towards addressing the spare availability issue, the Commands have been advised to promulgate class-of-ship wise MSL and direct MOs to maintain the MSL at all times. Action completed by HQWNC and HQENC.  (c) Single Point Responsibility/ Long term RCs with OEMs.    The above mentioned IHQ(N) policy letter accentuates the general misinterpretations which can lead to common errors in maintenance/ repairs of the system. Notwithstanding, the policy has laid emphasis on designation QC department of the yard with overall responsibility of ensuring refit activities/ checks as per the procedures mandated in NO 03/21. Further, involvement of OEMs, by respective Commands, through suitable RRCs/ AMCs has also been recommended in the policy.  (d) Diver Replaceable Anodes.    Fitment/ trials of diver replaceable anodes are in progress onboard INS Aditya. This would obviate the requirement to dry dock the vessel for undertaking ICCP repairs. NCD 3922 would be revised accordingly post completion of the trials. ",Admin-00101,2023-04-26 19:03:38.0300000 +00:00,5,30,2

176,56,Post,MIF,STANDARDIZATION OF HELO DECK SAFETY FRAME ARRANGEMENT,  Sir       At present  there are various guidelines governing where and how to fit/ install helo deck safety nets. These are primarily governed by Aviation safety requirements. Due to some other issues such as degutting  ease of maintenance etc  the frames/ shoes are at times welded onto the helo deck  sometimes on the ship side and at times with modified arrangements. There have been multiple instances in the past where work up teams recommend to change on a certain ship and the ship has got it done during next AMP/ refit. Threeafter  the aviation inspection/ Ops side indicates it as UNSAT and recommends changes. Each ship of same class at times has different arrangement due to lack of clarity and it is a perennial issue. Re-work also has effect on helo deck paint touch up and and its guarantee. Thus  there is a need to standardize the fitment of helo deck frames once and for all catering to all aviation  safety and functional requirement. It is  strongly recommended that a class of ship-wise standard arrangement be promulgated as a policy directive to put an end to constant changes. The policy may cater suitably to type of aircraft handling of a certain deck  oblique/ astern approach of helo  etc. A suitable change management plan for the same is also recommended. ,Hull,"Prima facie, this issue pertains to conflicting requirements of seamanship and aviation in the context of placement of Helo Deck Safety Nets (HDSN).   INBR 1760 mandates that in lowered position, the height of the safety nets should be lesser than 50mm in MTRLA and 150mm at deck edge (whichever is applicable, based on rotor-wing craft and deck landing area). HQFOST mandates the nets to have 10 deg upward slope to ensure rollback of personnel on deck. Thus, geometrically speaking, to align with aviation side, HDSN are to affixed on the ship sides.  The seamanship side /DSR highlighted the concerns of ship staff that HDSN at ship sides tend to cause damage to fittings when ships come alongside.  This case has been extensively deliberated at IHQ between WDB, DSR and DNAS. The following emerged:-  (a) For new construction ships -  HDSN at ship side at all locations.  (b) For in-service ships – wherever MRLTA and oblique approach posits problems, HDSN is to be fitted at ship-side. Additionally, 03 in number protector pieces covered with sacrificially damaging polymeric rubber piece (at 07 deg cant from the vertical) are to be provisioned along the length of the helo deck on Port and Starboard side to obviate damage while berthing alongside.

177,57,Post,MIF,INDIGENISATION OF RUSSIAN MISSILE MODULES,   The major challenge being faced in indigenisation or indigenous repairs of modules of Russian-origin missiles is non availability of ICDs. Therefore  till date Missile TPs have been able to indigenise limited number of modules of vintage non-integrated Russian-origin missiles such as P-series and RZ-61 and their missile test stands. For integrated Russian missiles viz. Club  Kashmir and Shtil  the private vendors have expressed their reservations due to non-availability of detailed technical documentation and ICDs.   To support legacy Russian origin missiles till end of their service life  indigenous solutions which replicate form  fit and functionality is the way ahead. Towards this  naval personnel with background of Microwave Engineering  Signal Processing  Compute Engineering  Reliability Engineering etc can make significant contributions to identify the problem areas and formulate technical solutions to enhance the operational availability and reliability of Russian-origin missiles and its support equipment such as Missile Test Station.

178,58,Post,MIF,LIFECYLE APPROACH TOWARDS MAINTENANCE OF ENGINEERING MACHINERY,  Dear Sir(s) and collegues    It is a matter of fact that any procurement  maintenance and repair in the navy is considered primarly based on financial implications. To name a few  we find DLs and RAs being deleted from refit/ AMP packages  spares excluded from recommended OEM list in OBS and B&D  parts being cannabilised from operational machinery of ships in refit for rectifying onging defects on operational ships etc. All these actions are either towards bringing down the cost or to decrease the down-time of equipment. The three major organisations involved in the entire lifecylce of a engieering equipment is IHQ MoD(N)  Material Organisation and Naval Dockyards. Synergy between a ship right from its comissioning to the operational phase and during de-commisioning with these three organisation is highly required for a fruitful management of engineering machinery. Sometimes  the lack of planning  foresight and unprecedented defects creates situation which have drastic effects on either the machinery itself or on the money spent on its management. It is time that we think about managing our engineering machinery onboard with an approach which includes assets procurement  operation  maintenance and disposal.     In generi context  asset management (AM) is a further evolution in the maintenence regime and is defined as a much better and more business focused maintenance (Woodstock 2006). AM combines risk-controlled  optimised and life-cycle management of an assest. To break it down into Engineering machinery aspect  the following is part of assest management:-    1. Standardisation of equipments especially auxiliaries and diesel engines    2. Procurements of these equipment in as large numbers as we can wherein equipment are supplied as per current requirement  others are stored and warehoused by the firm    3. Fitment and setting up of these equipments are done by the firm    4. Trainng on operation and ship staff maintenance is delivered during setting up and on regular intervals as per OCRC cycle of the ship    5. Breakdown maintenace is carried out as part of Rate Contract    6. Major overhauls and replacement during mid-life upgradation is carried out as per OCRC of the ship    7. Disposal/ Survey of parts and BER equipment is directly carried out by the firm    8. Regular checks as part of CBPM may also be part of maintenece by the firm    A comprehensive contract which considers all points mentioned above may be taken up during initial procurement of machinery. Financial implications for new machinery can be compared with similar machinery in service by calculateing costs involved during procurement from OEM  setting up cost by comissioning yards  maintenance costs during lifespan of the equipment or ship from ship and yard  and finally cost of spares  stowage  warehousing  transportation and disposal from MO.    Another important aspect is the role of WOT/ trial agencies in accepting these equipment during setting up or repair. All trail agencies should have personnel who are certified to carryout acceptance or quality assesment like an inspector in a civial yard or in the merchant navy holds.       Such an approach towards maintenance will not only decrease the down-time of equipment but also de-stress the chain involved in life-cycle mamangement of the machinery.          ,Marine Engineering,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,34,0

Kudos!    While I have not had the oppurtinity to read your article in JEEE/ Rozi Light  based on limited reading I have on subject till day  I would suggest that you may check up on following aspects before the model to be 'deployable' grade.    1. ML models are never static and are continiously evolving  so there is a requirement to keep the model to be fed with sufficient new data to ensure that it remains relevant. Necessary mechanisms have to be factored.    2. Model Selection and selection of performance metrics are the core essentials  so an interaction with users (domain experts) wrt selection of metrics is required before a model is considered to be a viable candidate.    3. Care has to be taken that the model is not overfitting (too acurate) or under-fitting. A very common problem. Zero Error Syndrome here is a definite no-no.    4. Undertake data augmentation and ensure that data does not have a class skew.    5. Try evaluating the data against various pre-trained models and see which model works the best for your case.    6. Since computing resources are going to me limited at the edge system (user end)  model also needs to be computationally light.    7. Along with image data check whether you can incorporate ESM data as additional parameters for the classification to be more robust.    8.  Implement MLOPS loop to ensure model reliability and sustainaility.         This is the only few things that come to my mind.

203,85,Query,MIF,Alternate Marine Fuel,"Is there any research on alternate marine fuel for surface ships being undertaken by the Indian Navy? If yes, may I please know which fuel are we looking into and where is the research being carried out?",Marine Engineering,"Background. INECR promulgates usage of B-20 blend biodiesel for Shore Generators and MT vehicles as a short-term goal and on small, medium and capital ships as medium-term goal.   2. IN Biodiesel Programme.   As part of the IN Biodiesel Programme, it is intended to commence regular use of biodiesel in a phased manner, commencing with MT vehicles and FICs. Accordingly, a dialogue was initiated with DIBER for provisioning of biodiesel for Naval use in 2016. However, DIBER in consultation with DRDO HQs, intimated that while the requirement of biodiesel for limited trials/ demonstration can be met by them, regular/ continued supply for use on FICs, as part of IN Biodiesel Programme, may not be possible.   3.  Trials Conducted. As part of the IN Biodiesel Programme, trials of indigenously developed biodiesel (produced from Jatropha Curacas) synthesized by DIBER-DRDO, were undertaken in four stages on MT vehicles, shore-based Diesel Generator, DA on a Ferry Craft and DE/ DA on a FIC in 2014-2016. Upon successful trials, demonstration of use of indigenous biodiesel on a FIC during Presidential Review was undertaken during IFR-2016. Details of biodiesel trials undertaken is enumerated below:-   (a) SNC : MT vehicles at INS Shivaji (Nov - Dec 14).  (b) WNC : DG set of fuel barge -7 (Oct 15).  (c) ENC : Shore Generator at Naval Dockyard (Oct 15).             FIC T-311 (Jan 16).             FIC 211 (Mar 21).  4. Deliberations with IOCL. Towards transition to biofuel in a sequential manner, IOCL has been continuously engaged over the past few years to provide sustained supply of biodiesel for MT vehicles, however, unavailability of sustained supply of biodiesel has been an area of concern. In Feb 19, the firm agreed to supply B5 blended HSD and subsequent case was taken up for amendment in existing Rate Contract. Amendment to RC was completed in Dec 19. In the last year, M/s IOCL has supplied 192 KL of B-7 blended Biodiesel for MT Vehicles at Vishakhapatnam, however, for sustained supply of biodiesel for use onboard IN ships, M/s IOCL has indicated non-availability on repeated tenders floated by the firm.  5.  Way ahead.       Towards transition to biofuel in a sequential manner from MT vehicles in Phase I; shore generators, FICs & auxiliary in Phase II and Capital Ships in Phase III. IOCL has been continuously engaged over the past few years to commence supply of biodiesel for MT vehicles, however, unavailability of sustained supply of biodiesel has been an area of concern. Although constant endeavors have been made by both IN-IOCL teams, the supply of biodiesel has not yet fructified for IN units. Interaction with the firm’s representatives over the past few months indicate that the firm is in process of setting up the biodiesel plants/ refineries in the country and one such facility has been completed in Panipat. Further, plan of action to counter hurdles towards biodiesel induction is being formulated in consultation with IOCL in the form of an approach paper and roadmap.  This may be treated as official repsonse of DME. ",Admin-00125,2023-04-24 12:56:36.9400000 +00:00,1,21,2

The concept of 'Balloon Docking' is innovative and could augment the dry dock capability of Yards with considerably low investment. However, the following aspects merit consideration wrt use of ‘balloon docking’ for IN ships: -  (a) This method would be less conducive for docking of ships with underwater appendages below keel (such as sonar dome, propeller, skeg, etc) as is the case with most naval ships, due to risk of damage to the appendage.  (b) The balloons would provide minimal side support, which is provided by shape side blocks or shores in case of normal dry docking. Hence, the method would be more suitable for flat bottom ships such as carrier, tankers, LSTs and certain yard crafts.  (c) Post docking, clearance below keel would be limited, to undertake any major underwater repairs.   2. Notwithstanding the above, 'Balloon Docking' could be used for emergency/ ops docking, when suitable dock slots are not available and limited underwater repair work is planned, subject to availability of favourably sloping waterfront area at the yard premises.

Has it been done before and what were the results? Though, it  has been promulgated by IHQ as good practices but supply has not commenced onboard for trial purposes. ",Hull,"The author of the post has sought information on effectiveness of the pellets in real time and commencement of supply onboard. With regards to effectiveness of pellets, trial application of corrosion inhibiting pellets was undertaken with steel coupons immersed in bilge water having inhibitor pellets dispersed, onboard Kolkata & Beas. The pellets comprise of Gluconate & Molybdate salts of zinc, sodium and calcium for corrosion inhibition of HSLA steel in bilge waters. It was observed during the trials that the pellets formed a protective inhibitor layer by adsorbing the inhibitor component on the metal surface thereby reducing the contact of the metal from bilge water. Based on gravimetric (weight loss) analysis, a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 90% was achieved during the trials. With regards to commencement of supply onboard, IHQ/DNA vide letter NC/0528 dated 28 Feb 23 had requested Command HQs to forward ship wise details to respective MOs by Mar 23 towards inclusion of corrosion inhibiting pellets as ARS for supply onboard IN ships. Accordingly, Command HQs have forwarded the ship wise details to MOs in Mar 23 and procurement action at MOs is in progress. Additionally, in order to meet the interim requirement of Corrosion Inhibitor Pellets, on request of IHQ/ DNA, NMRL has manufactured 400 kgs of pellets which have been distributed to respective Command Headquarters (100 kgs each). The supply of these pellets is in progress and has been completed on various class of ships viz Vikramaditya, Aditya & Deepak, B class, Teg class, Talwar class, P15B, P17A, Makar, FAC, WJFAC etc. Further, onsite training has been undertaken by NMRL for SS at respective command HQs towards effective/ proper usage of the pellets.",Admin-00101,2023-05-10 18:20:23.9766667 +00:00,3,41,2
